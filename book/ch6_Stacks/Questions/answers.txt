c-6.15: When using only one comparision, we can check to see if
the current node is biggest or its next node. But we don't have 
access to the next next node. So the biggest node should either 
be the first node or its next, for us to determine it correctly.
The chance of having it at the first two: - - | - is 4 and they
are 6 permutations which will give us 4/6=2/3.

c-6.19: Instead pushing the whole content between the two tags,
only the first word which is the tag, should be pushed.
